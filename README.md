### gulp-file-combiner
A simple, dumb and versatile file combiner for gulp.

It's gulp-file-include[https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-file-include] just more simple and versatile.

It can also do the same as gulp-pseudoconcat-js[https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-pseudoconcat-js], gulp-html-extend[https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-html-extend], gulp-include-2[https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-include-2]... and many more.

It does one thing and it does it well.

##Features

- Full customization of the syntax for detecting includes
- It allows to modify and customize how files are accessed in the include (you can make "fake symlinks")
- It takes in only vinyl files, __allowing you to preprocess the included files__ (surprisingly, other libraries don't!)
- It only outputs files that re not included by any other file

This allows it to be highly compatible with other gulp tools.
